If you repeatedly fail to prequalify for a payday loan, it probably means you don’t meet the requirements for citizenship, age, or income, and/or can’t provide a valid email address, phone number, or bank account number. Income is generally the biggest approval factor when it comes to short-term lenders.

Assuming you do prequalify, the reasons for loan denial depend on the loan type you request:

 Payday loan: You cannot prove you’re currently employed or that you receive the wages required for loan instant approval.
Short-term personal loan: A very poor credit score could cause a lender to reject your loan application. In addition, derogatory items on your credit report, including late payments, collections, write-offs, debt settlements, foreclosures, and bankruptcies, could sour your loan prospects.
